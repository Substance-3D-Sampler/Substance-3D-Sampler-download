## About Substance 3D Sampler

Developed by **Adobe**, Substance 3D Sampler (previously known as *Substance Alchemist*) revolutionizes the way artists build digital materials.  

Using AI and photogrammetry, it converts **real-world photographs** into seamless, physically accurate PBR textures — including color, height, normal, roughness, and AO channels.  

The tool also offers **layer-based material blending**, allowing artists to combine multiple sources, procedural filters, and decals into one unified material.  

Sampler is the fastest way to **create, edit, and organize textures**, whether for games, film, or visualization — and it integrates perfectly with **Substance 3D Painter, Designer, and Stager**.
